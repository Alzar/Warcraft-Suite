# Warcraft Suite

Warcraft Suite is an Invision Power Board application which aims to add certain functionality desired for facilitating guild website functionality. It provides an easily customizable raid progress widget and class & spec recruitment widget.

*Warcraft Suite's development was ceased before it was completed and so some functionality may have issues related to it. This project is not maintained and is hosted on GitHub purely as a way to bookmark the progress I made on it and allow any future devs interested in such a product to use.*
